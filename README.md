# Sudoku-Solver
C++ Implementation of a Sudoku Solver

A C++ program designed to take a sudoku puzzle as input, and calculate the answer using recursive methods. This was my first larger sized C++ implementation.

Please see example .dat input files, and main file for how to use the program.

Please first compile the code with 'make' in the command line, before running ./sudoku.
